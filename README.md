This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to divide by the variable `Y`, which is initialized to zero. This will result in a CONSTRAINT_ERROR exception at runtime. The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.
